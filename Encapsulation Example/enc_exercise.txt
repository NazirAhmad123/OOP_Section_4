/*
	* Create a class called Printer and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques.
	* It will simulate a real computer printer.
	* It should have fields for the inkLevel, number of pages printed and also
	* whether it is a duplex printer. (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).
	* add methods to fill up the ink level, (up to a maximum of 100 percent).
	* add another method to simulate printing of a page. (which should increase the number
	* pages printed.)
	* Decide on the scope whether to user constructor, and anything else you think is needed.
