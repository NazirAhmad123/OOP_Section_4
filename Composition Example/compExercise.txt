//Inheritance.
we had. is-A. 
//Composition.
we have. has-A
// PC  has -> A-case, A-monitor, A-motherboard.

Try to show the use of composition doing the below exercise.

Create a single room of a house using composition. e.g: Bedroom.
Think about the things that should be included in the Bedroom.
Maybe physical parts (e.g: walls, ceiling) of the house but furnitures as well  ( e.g: Bed, lamp). 
	
	   // some that you might think of:
									1. Bed -> Style, pillows, height,  sheets, quilt.
									// method: make()
									2. Wall -> Direction
									3. Ceiling -> height, painedColor
									4. Lamp -> Style, battery
									   // method: turnOn()

Add at least one method to access an object via getter and then that objects public methods as you saw in the previous example.
then add at least one method to hide the object.
e.g: not using a getter but to access the object used in composition within the main class.

// Call the make() and turnOn() methods in your main methods and see how it works. using the Bedroom Object.
