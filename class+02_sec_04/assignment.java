assignment 1

Create a method called displayHighScorePosition().
It should return a player's name and position in the high score table
You should display the players name with a message like
(name) Managed to get into position (position) in the high score table.

e.g: Ali managed to get into position 1th in the high score table.

Create a second method called calculateHighScorePosition().
It should be sent an argument, the players score.
It should return an int (the player's position).

the position should be based on the following:
1th if the score > 1000
2th if the score > 500 && score < 1000
3th if the score > 100 && score < 500
4th all other cases.

call both methods and display the result of the scores of 1500, 900, 400 and 50.
