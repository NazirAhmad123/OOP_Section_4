

Start with a base class of a vehicle, then create a car class that inhirates from this base class.
Finally, create another class, a specific type of car that inhirates from car class.

You should be able to handle steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).
You'll want to decide where to put the appropriate states and behaviors (fields and methods).
As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/descreasing speed should be included.
For your specific type of car you should add something specific to that type of car.
