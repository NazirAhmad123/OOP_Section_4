public class Main {
//	Create a new class for a account.
//	Create fields for the account acc_number, balance, customer name, 
	//email, and phone number.
//	Create getters and setter for each.
//	Create two additional methods.
//	  1. To allow the customer to deposit funds 
	//(this would increment the balance field).
//	  2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. 
	//(this should deduct from the balance field,
//	  		but not allow the withdrawal to complete if the balance
	//		is not sufficient.
//	  You will want to create various code in the main class 
	//to conform your code is working.
//	  add some System.out.println's in the two methods above as well.
//
